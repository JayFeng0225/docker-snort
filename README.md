docker-snort
============

Snort in a Docker Container

Install
============

- Clone the repo
- Go to the debs directory
- run run.sh to build the requirements
-- Note some steps might be missing here:
--- I don't install the libpfring or the kernel module on the host. Need to test with clean VM
- If everything works out correctly, you should be able to run the test.sh script and run snort using the /run.sh file
